# The inputs for the amount of different colored plates
red_plates = int(input(""));
green_plates = int(input(""));
blue_plates = int(input(""));

# The output 
cost = 0;

# The math involved in figuring out the cost based on the amount of plates and their case per unit

cost = (red_plates * 3) + (green_plates * 4) + (blue_plates * 5);

print(cost)
